# Machine Learning Practice


Work that I do while learning or practicing on a machine learning can be found here.

## Content list.

#### Note books

[Linear Regression](https://github.com/MrRutledge/ML_Practice/blob/master/Linear_Regression/Linear_Regression%20.ipynb)

My implementation of Linear Regression, Cross validation and model interpretation methods

[House prices](https://github.com/MrRutledge/ML_Practice/blob/master/House_Price_Analysis/House_Prices_Dataset.ipynb)

This notebook I used Kaggles's Housing dataset to implement Random Forest, the aim was to predict the price of the House using FastAI Library.

[California Houses](https://github.com/MrRutledge/ML_Practice/blob/master/California_Median_House/CaliHousesdataset.ipynb)

In this notebook I follow an End to End process of a machine learning project. I use chapter two of [Hands on Machine learning with Scikit Learn](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) by Aurelien Geron

[FastAi Machine Learning Course](./FastAi_Machine_learning_Lessons/FastAi_ML_RandomForest.ipynb)
This notebook is a collection of notes from the FastAi Machine Learning Course from Lesson one to lesson seven.

[Boston Dataset](https://github.com/MrRutledge/ML_Practice/blob/master/Boston/Boston%20Dataset.ipynb)

My implementation of Linear Regression using machine learning techniques from multiple sources.
