Work that I do while learning or practicing on a machine learning can be found here.

## Content list.

#### Note books

[Linear Regression](./Linea_Regression.ipynb)

My implementation of Linear Regression, Cross validation and model interpretation methods

[House prices](./House_Prices_Dataset.ipynb)

This notebook I used Kaggles's Housing dataset to implement Random Forest, I aim was to predict the price of the House using FastAI Library.

[California Houses](./CaliHousesdataset.ipynb)

In this notebook I follow an End to End process of a machine learning project. I use chapter two of Hands on Machine learning with Scikit Learn by Aurelion G

[FastAi Machine Learning Course](./FastAi_ML_RandomForest.ipynb)
This notebook is a collection of notes from the FastAi Machine Learning Course from Lesson one to lesson seven.

[Boston Dataset](./"Boston Dataset.ipynb")

My implementation of Linear Regression using machine learning techniques from various sources.
